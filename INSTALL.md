### [Starship Powerline Preset](https://starship.rs/presets/)

This preset is heavily inspired by the Catppuccin Powerline and Pastel Powerline presets.

This config also assumes you have a Nerd Font installed per the Starship installation guide.

#### Install manually

Download using the [GitHub `.zip` download](https://github.com/dracula/foobar/archive/main.zip) option and unzip them.

#### Activating theme

To start with a new config:

1. Make a backup of ~/.config/starship.toml

```cp ~/.config/starship.toml ~/.config/starship.toml.bak2
```

2. Copy downloaded `starship.toml` to `~/.config/starship.toml`. Replace the file if it currently exists.

If you are familiar enough with the Starship config, you can add this to an existing config. Be cautions that you understand the changes.
